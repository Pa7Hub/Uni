# University Projects
This repository holds all my University Projects (Homework, Thought experiments, Just for fun implementations). Public so that others can take a look and learn a few things. 

Feel free to send me questions, I'm happy to help! (;

Currently lies dormant as everything that I am coding for Uni is versioned on a different, private Git. So as for now, there won't be any commits here, as all my projects and thought experiments will be housed somewhere else. Let's hope it doesn't stay that way. (;
